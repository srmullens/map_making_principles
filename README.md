#Map-Making Principles:
* Plotting data is nothing.
* Communication; not data.
* Plot for action.
* Merge observations and models.
* Binaries are sharp.
* Probabilities are fuzzy.
* Grids are pixeled.
* Threshold is singular.
* Interpolate contours, sparingly.
* Objectify subjective claims.
* Favor observations.
